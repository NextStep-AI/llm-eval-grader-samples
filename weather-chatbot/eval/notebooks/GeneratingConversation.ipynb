    "# How to use the conversation generator tools\n",
    "In this notebook, we will show how to use the conversations generation tools to:\n",
    "1. Generate and save one conversation with one emulated user\n",
    "1. Generate and save one conversation with one emulated user given a scenario\n",
    "1. Generate and save multiple conversations with different emulated users (with or without scenario)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The conversation generation tool is used with the orchestrator to create conversation data when none exists. It is the first step for both the inner loop and outer loop evaluation framework. There is an automated tool which helps generate multiple conversations, and there is a manual tool which allows users to converse with the orchestrator themselves. Simply put, it works in 3 steps:\n",
    "1.\tGenerate an emulated user prompt. Optionally instruct it with a specific scenario. (This step can be skipped if using the manual tool.)\n",
    "1.\tCarry N turns of conversations between the emulated user and the orchestrator.\n",
    "1.\tSave the conversation to be used by the inner loop or outer loop evaluation framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Emulated Users\n",
    "To carry out a conversation with an orchestrator, we need to emulate a user. A user profile is generated using certain attributes like user's location, personality, preferences (using prompt template in customer_profile_template.py). Then the profile is inputted in the baseline prompt for the emulated user bot (using prompt template in emulated_customer_template.py). There are 2 baseline prompts, one with a scenario and one without. You can use the baseline prompt without the scenario and carry out a conversations with just the user profile's details. Or you can give it a specific scenario to carry out in the conversation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The tools give 2 ways to emulate a user: The standard user generator and the random user generator.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Standard User Generator\n",
    "The standard user generator loops through a predefined list of user profiles (under eval\\library\\conversation_generator\\user_generation\\data\\user_profiles.json). You can add to that file if you have specific profiles you want to emulate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Random User Generator\n",
    "The random user generator tool first builds a random user profile by looping through user profile data (under eval\\library\\conversation_generator\\customer_profile_data). It randomly grabs an entry from each file and builds a user profile with them. You can add more to those files as well if needed\n",

An index of 11 or more is classified as \"extreme\" and means that unprotected skin and eyes can burn in minutes. It's recommended to avoid outdoor activities around midday when the sun is the strongest, seek shade, wear protective clothing, a wide-brimmed hat, and UV-blocking sunglasses, and use a broad-spectrum sunscreen with an SPF of 30 or higher.
